# rummy-scoresheet

A gin rummy scoresheet, written for personal use and as an exercise in learning the building tool
Parcel.

To run locally, download, run `npm install` and then `npm start`. That should open a browser
window on Parcel's default location, [Localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234/). As of this point,
all data lives only in the single-page app and is not stored locally, so don't refresh unless you
want to lose your data.

As of March 2, 2021, this has been updated from Parcel 1 to Parcel 2. Hopefully, this doesn't create any issues.
